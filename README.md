# SIGNALS AND SYSTEMS - MATLAB PROJECT

This repository contains the MATLAB script developed for the project of the course "Signals and Systems", taken during the third semester at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens.

//Update: This repository includes the equivalent Python Code. If the audio files are missing, the script will skip the sections regarding audio processing (the try...except blocks) and only plot the filter characteristics from Section 1.
